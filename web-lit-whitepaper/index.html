      <h2> Authors: Authors: An-Me Chung, Iris Bond Gill, Ian O'Byrne</h2>

      <p>
        This paper captures the evolution of the Mozilla Web Literacy Map to reach and meet the growing number of <a href="#personas">diverse audiences</a> using the web. The paper represents the thinking, research findings, and next iteration of the Web Literacy Map that embraces 21st Century Skills (21C Skills) as key to leadership development.

      <p>
        As technology becomes more ubiquitous, and more people come online, Mozilla continues to refine its strategies to support and champion the web as an open and public resource. To help people become good citizens of the web, Mozilla focuses on the following goals: 1) develop more educators, advocates, and community leaders who can leverage and advance the web as an open and public resource, and 2) impact policies and practices to ensure the web remains a healthy open and public resource for all. In order to accomplish this, we need to provide people with open access to the skills and know-how needed to use the web to improve their lives, careers, and organizations.

        Knowing how to read, write, and participate in the digital world has become the 4th basic foundational skill next to the three Rs&mdash;reading, writing, and arithmetic&mdash;in a rapidly evolving, networked world. Having these skills on the web expands access and opportunity for more people to learn anytime, anywhere, at any pace. Combined with 21C leadership Skills (i.e. critical thinking, collaboration, problem solving, creativity, communication), these digital-age skills help us live and work in today’s world. Whether you’re a first time smartphone user, an educator, an experienced programmer, or an internet activist, the degree to which you can read, write, and participate on the web while producing, synthesizing, evaluating, and communicating information shapes what you can imagine&mdash;and what you can do.  follows:
      </p>

      <h4>Specifically, these skills are described as:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>“Read”</strong> is how we explore the web. Web literate individuals understand basic web mechanics such as the difference between names and addresses on the web, and how data is linked and moves through the infrastructure of the web. They can evaluate web content, and identify what is useful and trustworthy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Write”</strong> is how we build the web. Web literate individuals can transform a word into a hyperlink and add media to websites. As abilities are honed, one becomes more adept at remixing other users’ content and understanding or writing code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“Participate”</strong> is how we connect on the web. It includes interacting with others to making your own experience and the web richer to working in the open. It also includes having a grasp of security basics, like protecting your online identity and avoiding online scams.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“21C Skills”</strong> refers to a broad set of knowledge, skills, work habits, and character traits that are important to succeed in today’s world, particularly for college and career readiness and in the workplace. Examples of these skills include collaboration, communication, creativity, and problem-solving.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="research-findings">Research Findings</h2>

      <p>
        In 2013, Mozilla and community stakeholders designed the first <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/">Web Literacy Map</a> to identify a set of core web literacy skills, and set the stage for engaging individuals as makers on the web. As our strategies evolved to meet the needs of the growing numbers of diverse audiences using the web, we began to ask questions such as:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Are these concepts helpful if we’re talking about people across a wide variety of skill levels and needs? </li>
        <li>Does one need to code in order to be considered web literate? </li>
        <li>What leadership skills are being developed as a result? </li>
        <li>How does our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/Legacy/WebLiteraciesWhitePaper">first web literacy map</a> hold up?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We conducted a series of  focus groups, interviews, and in-person meet-ups that included teachers and in-school educators, scientists, afterschool leaders, community members, web and technology advocates and experts, and international leaders of emerging markets and digital learning networks. We also reviewed the <a href="https://blog.webmaker.org/author/laura-de-reynal">Mozilla field research</a> conducted in India, Kenya, Bangladesh, and Chicago. What we concluded is that people needed the map to be more <em>approachable</em>, <em>accessible</em>, and <em>applicable</em> for learning and teaching web literacy skills.
      </p>

      <h4>Specifically, the map needs to be:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Approachable and accessible</strong> to diverse audiences and their needs. The map needs to be written in a language that is easy to understand, and relevant&mdash;why do web literacy skills matter to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Applicable</strong> to interest and/or expertise. The map needs to connect to curriculum, credentials, professional development, and other resources to teach people the skills they need to engage online and offline.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>And include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>21C Skills</strong> of communication, creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving that are important cross-cutting leadership skills to move from being a consumer to a maker on the web. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="web-literacy-skills">Web Literacy 2.0</h2>

      <p>
        From focus group findings and other research related to instructional practice, the web literacy map was updated to include language and practices that are more approachable. To help people identify why these skills should matter to them, the profiles generated from the focus group data represent examples of real people using web literacy skills in their everyday lives.  For increased applicability, these digital-age skills will be connected to curriculum, professional development, credentials, and other tools.
      </p>

      <h2 id="21st-century-skills">21st Century Skills and Leadership Development</h2>

      <p>As people learn to read, write, and participate on the web, a cross-cutting set of 21C Skills emerge as skills critical to success in today’s world. They enable individuals to become teachers, advocates, and community leaders to leverage and advance the web as an open and public resource.</p>

      <p>The 21C Skills, combined with the web literacy skills, are the nexus for entry-level digital-age skills.  They are a set of abilities such as problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, or communication that people need to develop in order to succeed in the information age.  These skills have always been critical, and even more so in an information-based economy.  When most workers held jobs in industry, the key skills were knowing a trade, following directions, getting along with others, working hard, and being professional. To hold information-age jobs, people also need to think deeply about issues, solve problems creatively, work in teams, communicate clearly in many media, learn ever-changing technologies.</p>

      <p>As part of our <a href="https://blog.webmaker.org/digital-age-skills-for-educators">Digital Skills for Digital-Age Leadership Development</a> project, we have conducted research and are working closely with expert advisory groups to create a set of open badges to capture 21C skills and competencies and prototype digital badges to make learning and achievement outcomes count towards college and career readiness, and workforce development. The resulting <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/file/d/0B9qOTaXg3UmRaEJieEY0MkdtTFk/view">21C skills framework</a> and rubric includes a core set of skills and competencies important for leadership development that allows people and programs to customize assessments that capture 21C Skills based on relevant content.

          My name is Mr. G and I am a high school music teacher. I’m interested in teaching my students to be responsible citizens of the web given how active they are in making and remixing digital music. With all the issues about copyrights and licenses, I need resources that will help educate me and them about these issues as well how to be a good collaborator and leader.

          My name is Maya, and I work at an afterschool program where middle school students participate in a variety of activities from homework help to creating their own online movies. Kids love this program, but we have parents who are concerned about security and privacy. We need a workshop or set of activities to help participants and their parents understand how to protect their privacy and be able to develop and share movies in the open.

          Recasting the reader as a navigator has important implications for learning and literacy. It involves making meaning online beyond traditional reading skills. (Duke &amp; Pearson, 2002; Leu, O’Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, &amp; Everett-Cacopardo, 2009).

            As writing moves from page to screen one of the key differences between the traditional writing process and online content construction is that individuals need to consider other elements that are particularto working with online informational text (e.g., semiotics, visual literacy, multimodal design). As the writing process moves from print to pixel, writing needs to take into account the reader/writer nature of content in a digital space. In computer science, read/write is defined as media that is capable of being displayed (read) and modified (write). In a literacy context, the reader/writer nature of online information could be viewed as a means to allow individuals to quickly and efficiently comprehend and construct online information (O’Byrne, 2014).

          Thus, the skills and competencies under the participating strand encompass the values of not only connecting with, but also protecting the values of the open web. In these activities, sharing is essential to creating the many small pieces of the web (Alexander, 2006). Individuals that excel as good participators on the open web collaborate as both a mentor and learner while sharing and creating resources in different spaces (Jenkins, 2009). By participating and connecting in these spaces, and in their specific practices, we connect as an online learning community (Wenger, McDermott, &amp; Snyder, 2002).
