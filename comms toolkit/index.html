      <h2 id="core-messaging">Core Messaging</h2>

      <p>
        In 2013, Mozilla and community stakeholders designed the first <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/">Web Literacy Map</a> to identify a set of core web literacy skills, and set the stage for engaging individuals as makers on the web. As our strategies evolved to meet the needs of the growing numbers of diverse audiences using the web, we began to ask questions such as:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Are these concepts helpful if we’re talking about people across a wide variety of skill levels and needs? </li>
        <li>Does one need to code in order to be considered web literate? </li>
        <li>What leadership skills are being developed as a result? </li>
        <li>How does our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/Legacy/WebLiteraciesWhitePaper">first web literacy map</a> hold up?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We conducted a series of  focus groups, interviews, and in-person meet-ups that included teachers and in-school educators, scientists, afterschool leaders, community members, web and technology advocates and experts, and international leaders of emerging markets and digital learning networks. We also reviewed the <a href="https://blog.webmaker.org/author/laura-de-reynal">Mozilla field research</a> conducted in India, Kenya, Bangladesh, and Chicago. What we concluded is that people needed the map to be more <em>approachable</em>, <em>accessible</em>, and <em>applicable</em> for learning and teaching web literacy skills.
      </p>

      <h4>Specifically, the map needs to be:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Approachable and accessible</strong> to diverse audiences and their needs. The map needs to be written in a language that is easy to understand, and relevant&mdash;why do web literacy skills matter to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Applicable</strong> to interest and/or expertise. The map needs to connect to curriculum, credentials, professional development, and other resources to teach people the skills they need to engage online and offline.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>And include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>21C Skills</strong> of communication, creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving that are important cross-cutting leadership skills to move from being a consumer to a maker on the web. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="web-literacy-skills">Visual Assets</h2>

      <p>
        From focus group findings and other research related to instructional practice, the web literacy map was updated to include language and practices that are more approachable. To help people identify why these skills should matter to them, the profiles generated from the focus group data represent examples of real people using web literacy skills in their everyday lives.  For increased applicability, these digital-age skills will be connected to curriculum, professional development, credentials, and other tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Read</h3>
      <p>
        Reading on the web is a critical skill for engaging content online. They can be viewed as “exploring,” or “navigating the web.” Just as traditional reading requires knowledge of the text and concepts of print, reading online requires a basic understanding of web mechanics. Good online readers know the tools and strategies that can be used to search for and locate people, resources, and information. They then know how to judge the credibility of these sources.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The web literacy skills  and competencies identified under reading on the web are as follows.
      </p>

      <h4>Search</h4>

      <h2 id="21st-century-skills">Templates</h2>

      <p>As people learn to read, write, and participate on the web, a cross-cutting set of 21C Skills emerge as skills critical to success in today’s world. They enable individuals to become teachers, advocates, and community leaders to leverage and advance the web as an open and public resource.</p>

      <p>The 21C Skills, combined with the web literacy skills, are the nexus for entry-level digital-age skills.  They are a set of abilities such as problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, or communication that people need to develop in order to succeed in the information age.  These skills have always been critical, and even more so in an information-based economy.  When most workers held jobs in industry, the key skills were knowing a trade, following directions, getting along with others, working hard, and being professional. To hold information-age jobs, people also need to think deeply about issues, solve problems creatively, work in teams, communicate clearly in many media, learn ever-changing technologies.</p>

      <p>As part of our <a href="https://blog.webmaker.org/digital-age-skills-for-educators">Digital Skills for Digital-Age Leadership Development</a> project, we have conducted research and are working closely with expert advisory groups to create a set of open badges to capture 21C skills and competencies and prototype digital badges to make learning and achievement outcomes count towards college and career readiness, and workforce development. The resulting <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/file/d/0B9qOTaXg3UmRaEJieEY0MkdtTFk/view">21C skills framework</a> and rubric includes a core set of skills and competencies important for leadership development that allows people and programs to customize assessments that capture 21C Skills based on relevant content.

        With the generous and thoughtful input by many current and emerging community members, this paper generate the latest version of Mozilla’s Web Literacy Map that includes 21C skills, leadership skills and competencieswritten in language that is approachable and accessible to more people, and connected to curriculum to make it applicable for learning and teaching web literacy skills.  If you are a general user, we suggest you identify your own skill set and level up or identify others that want to level up in an area and if you are an proficient in particular area, help them out.  If you are someone who knows how to teach others, we encourage you to find ways to embed and remix Mozilla’s open source curriculum, professional development and other resources into your offerings and share what you are doing with us and others.

          My name is Mr. G and I am a high school music teacher. I’m interested in teaching my students to be responsible citizens of the web given how active they are in making and remixing digital music. With all the issues about copyrights and licenses, I need resources that will help educate me and them about these issues as well how to be a good collaborator and leader.

          My name is Maya, and I work at an afterschool program where middle school students participate in a variety of activities from homework help to creating their own online movies. Kids love this program, but we have parents who are concerned about security and privacy. We need a workshop or set of activities to help participants and their parents understand how to protect their privacy and be able to develop and share movies in the open.

          Recasting the reader as a navigator has important implications for learning and literacy. It involves making meaning online beyond traditional reading skills. (Duke &amp; Pearson, 2002; Leu, O’Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, &amp; Everett-Cacopardo, 2009).

            As writing moves from page to screen one of the key differences between the traditional writing process and online content construction is that individuals need to consider other elements that are particularto working with online informational text (e.g., semiotics, visual literacy, multimodal design). As the writing process moves from print to pixel, writing needs to take into account the reader/writer nature of content in a digital space. In computer science, read/write is defined as media that is capable of being displayed (read) and modified (write). In a literacy context, the reader/writer nature of online information could be viewed as a means to allow individuals to quickly and efficiently comprehend and construct online information (O’Byrne, 2014).

          Thus, the skills and competencies under the participating strand encompass the values of not only connecting with, but also protecting the values of the open web. In these activities, sharing is essential to creating the many small pieces of the web (Alexander, 2006). Individuals that excel as good participators on the open web collaborate as both a mentor and learner while sharing and creating resources in different spaces (Jenkins, 2009). By participating and connecting in these spaces, and in their specific practices, we connect as an online learning community (Wenger, McDermott, &amp; Snyder, 2002).
